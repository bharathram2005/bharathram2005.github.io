<h1>Wildlife: The beauty of Nature</h1>

<h2>Territorial Animals</h2>
<p>In ethology (science of animal behavior), territory is the sociographical area that an animal of a particular species consistently defends against conspecifics (or, occasionally, animals of other species). Animals that defend territories in this way are referred to as territorial. Territoriality is only shown by a minority of species.</p>

<h2>The Majesty Of A Predator</h2>
<p>Just imagine a life without fear. Nothing could be as peaceful than leading such a life. But it can be hard, very hard. But some species in the animal kingdom are lucky enough to enjoy a life without fear because there is no other animal to hunt them within their habitat. Humans are the only threat to such apex predators on Earth. </p>

<h2>The Biodiversity Of Animals</h2>
<p>Biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems.
Biodiversity forms the foundation of the vast array of ecosystem services that critically contribute to human well-being.
Biodiversity is important in human-managed as well as natural ecosystems.
Decisions humans make that influence biodiversity affect the well-being of themselves and others.</p>
