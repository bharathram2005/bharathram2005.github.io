<h1>My Bio</h1>
<h2>My name is Bharath Ram, I am 12 years old, and I live in Naples. I go to Oakridge Middle School.  and I am one of the students who attended the NSF programming class. THe class has taught me a lot about programming in general, and has expanded my abilities immensely. Before I went to this class. I knew absolutely nothing about programming. This course has taught me a lot about coding in the three fundamental languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am going to show you some of the wonderful programs we made, both in class, and on our own for homework.</h2>
