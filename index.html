<h4>My NSF Programming</h4>
<h1>My Bio</h1>
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
	<td><h2>My name is Bharath Ram and my hometown is Naples, Florida. I am 12 years old and am a 7th grader at Oakridge Middle School. I am one of the students who attended this year's NSF programming class. Before I went to this class. I knew absolutely nothing about programming. This course has taught me a lot about coding in the three of the core languages, <u><i><b>HTML</b></i></u>(which provides basic structure/layout), <u><i><b>CSS</b></i></u>(which provides glamour, formatting, and style), and <u><i><b>JavaScript</b></i></u>(which gives you procedural logic). I am going to show you some of the wonderful programs we made, both in class, and on our own for homework.</h2></td>

<h1>Programs we made in class</h1>
<h3>1. We looked at slides and talked about programming and its various components. It was like an introduction to the world of programming.</h3>
<h3>2. This was our first time using JavaScript in connection with HTML. We did a couple of basic functions, such as finding out the date and time, or calculating the area of a circle based on its radius.</h3>
<a href="YourRadius.html">Area of a Circle</a><br>
<a href="DateandTime.html">Date and Time</a>
<h3>3. This was our first time using CSS. We created simple webpages but learned how to add style to them by playing around with things like <font color = "#c014ff">color</font>, <font face="algerian">font</font>, and <font size = "7">size</font>.</h3>
<a href="StylishExample.html">CSS Example</a>
<h3>4. This was our first time using all three languages together. 'UbbiDubbi' is a made-up language that follows specific rules(in this case, to add 'ub' before every vowel). It was a challenging project.</h3>
<a href="UbbiDubbi.html">UbbiDubbi</a>
<h3>5. This week, we used a program called Thunkable to create apps, to gain a better understanding of programming.</h3>
<h3>6. We learned how to use arrays, a function of JavaScript that allows you to organize a list of objects better.</h3>
<a href="ArrayExample.html">Array Example</a>
<h3>7. We learned how to use APIs in our code to use functions that were too complicated for us to code ourselves. APIs are pieces of code websites offer to the public. We used the Google Maps API.</h3>
<a href="MapsSample">My Detroit Map</a>
<h3>8. We learned how to publish our websites.</h3>

<h1>Programs we made for homework</h1>
<h3>1. We made our own webpage using some of the more basic features of programming.</h3>
<a href="MyAwesomeWebpage - No Styles.html">My First Webpage</a>
<h3>2. We defined some basic JavaScript terms and then designed a function to calculate the area of a triangle using Heron's Formula.</h3>
<a href="Heron's Formula.html">Heron's Formula</a>
<h3>3. This was our first practice of using CSS. We added font, color, size, and other elements of style to the webpage we created in Week 1.</h3>
<a href="MyAwesomeWebpage.html">Added CSS</a>
<h3>4. This was our first time practicing using all three languages together. 'Pig Latin' is another made-up language that follows specific rules. It was a challenging project.</h3>
<a href="PigLatin.html">Pig Latin</a>
<h3>5. This week, we analyzed some more famous Thunkable apps and wrote a paragraph for each one.</h3>
<h3>6. We created 2 functions.The first would be able to loop through an array and list all the odd numbers in the array, list all the even numbers in the array, and print them both out separately. The second one could calculate the median, mode, mean, and sum.</h3>
<a href="Week6HomeworkL1.html">Odd or Even?</a><br>
<a href="Week6HomeworkL2.html">Mean, Median, Mode, and Sum</a>
<h3>7. We used the Google Maps API to make maps of our hometowns with markers on important places in those towns.</h3>
<a href="MapsSample.html">My Hometown Map</a>
<h3>8. My homework this week was to make this website and publish it. :)</h3>
